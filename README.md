# DOS/4PI

DOS/4PI is a lightweight modification on top of the bas Raspberry Pi OS to make your Raspberry Pi
into a MS-DOS compatible computer.

If you are after a more versatile solution based on the same concept, we suggest that
you check out the great work of [Carmelo Maiolino's
Dosbian](https://cmaiolino.wordpress.com/dosbian/). Also be sure to check out 
the experimental builds with Windows 9x compatibility created by Daniel Å˜epka, found in the [Dosbian
facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Dosbian).

## pi-gen

This repository is an independent fork of the official
[pi-gen repository](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen). The goal is to touch as few files as
possible from the original directories so we can pull down critical updates in the future.
